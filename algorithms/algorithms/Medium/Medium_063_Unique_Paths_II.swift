 #63 Unique Paths II
 
 Level: medium
 
 Follow up for "Unique Paths":
 
 Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 
 An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
 
 For example,
 There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
 
 [
 [0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [0,0,0]
 ]
 The total number of unique paths is 2.
 
 Note: m and n will be at most 100.
